<H2>Description</H2>

This package, called JWintab is a very simple JNI (Java Native Interface) layer to the 
tablet library called WINTAB.  Wintab is a de-fact standard library on Windows and 
many tablet venders including WACOM support this interface.  JWintab is a very 
simple interface to Wintab (it essentially supports only one method), for allowing Java 
programmer to use WACOM tablet. This package was developed as a part of the 
ToolStone project at Sony Computer Science Laboratory.   We distribute no this 
package as open-source software, without any support or documentation beyond this file 
and the source code itself.
